# GoPro_Web_RC
Easily control multiple GoPros with the web browser via Bluetooth, without additional hardware.

## Important
I invested a lot more time in GoEasyPro_Android. https://github.com/sepp89117/GoEasyPro_Android

GoPro Bluetoothspecs are from https://gopro.github.io/OpenGoPro/ble

# Number of cameras tested simultaneously
The maximum number of simultaneous connections via BLE is theoretically not limited. However, some systems have limitations. A maximum of 7 simultaneous connections was tested under Windows. 14 simultaneous connections were successfully tested on an Android phone. Thanks to hellolwt for this information!

# How to start
1. Start your GoPro and start pairing with remote
2. Open the Bluetooth manager of your control device (PC, smartphone, etc.) and pair it with "GoPro XXXX". You will then receive a success message on both devices. (The "XXXX" in the name stands for the last 4 digits of the camera serial number)
3. Open "GoPro_Web_RC.html" locally in a supported web browser.
-  Alternatively, the HTML can be hosted over HTTPS. (Web Bluetooth requires TLS)
-  Or browse to https://sepp89117.github.io/GoPro_Web_RC/GoPro_Web_RC.html (thanks @KonradIT)
4. Click on "Connect/Pair new".
5. Your web browser will show you available GoPros. Choose one and click connect.
6. After successful connection, the camera is displayed in the "Connected devices" list.
7. Now you can add more cameras (step 4.) or control the connected cameras.

# TODO
- implement protobuf without external references
- implement some features from GoEasyPro_Android linke cam renaming

# Known Issues
- In the case of error messages with "NetworkError", the camera must be paired again with the control device.
- In the case of error messages with "NotSupportedError", the connections in the camera must first be reset and then paired again with the control device.
